Course coverage and Organization

Approximately five weeks will be spent on basic computation, and nine weeks on probability and statistics via computational methods. 

Week 1: Basic ideas of programming, units of computation, functions and loops.  Computational logic and legal logic, law as computation.  

Week 2: Files and Strings, Regular expressions. Focused legal application: data-wrangling in legal documents.

Week 3:  Documentation and debugging. Problem set 1 due.

Week 4:  Basic principles of probability.  Focused legal application: loss of a chance in torts.

Week 5: Examining data, measures of central tendency, computational exploratory analysis and data visualization.  
 
Week 6: Conditional probability, Independence, Bayes Rule.  Focused legal application: tests and error rates. Problem set 2 due.

Week 7: Probability distributions, Central limit theorem.

Week 8: Hypothesis testing, statistical epistemology. Focused legal application: statistical evidence of discrimination.

Week 9. Statistical dangers (part 1): Statistical significance and its misuse, statistical power, common statistical blunders, paradoxes, and fallacies.  Statistical evidence of discrimination continued, the famous Berkeley sex discrimination/Simpsonâ€™s paradox case.

Week 10.  Statistical dangers (part 2), continuation of previous week.  Problem set 3 due.

Week 11.  Linear regression (and ways it can go wrong). Logistic regression as minor extension on linear regression.

Week 12: Correlation vs. causation.  Experiments, quasi-experiments, natural experiments.  

Week 13: Prediction and machine learning.  Focused legal application: predicting judicial outcomes.

Week 14: Text as data, natural language processing.  Focused legal application: machine-reading contracts.  Problem set 4 due.

Material designated for weeks 13 and 14 may be omitted if earlier weeks require more time, depending on student progress.
