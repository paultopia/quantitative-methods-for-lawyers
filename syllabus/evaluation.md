# Evaluation

Evaluation will be based on four problem sets.  The first two will be computer programming-based, and will be worth 20% of the grade each; the last two will be probability and statistics based and will be worth 30% of the grade each.

Pursuant to Student Handbook section B.3 ("The curve is not applicable in upper-level seminars and other upper- level classes in which a student's grade is based primarily on the student’s performance on graded skills-oriented tasks (including writing) other than a final exam."), this course will not be curved.  

In order to ensure that students in this course aren’t disadvantaged by unfamiliarity with the format or a collection of too-hard problem sets on which everyone struggles, there will be a floor curve for this course: at the lowest, the median grade for this course will be the official law school median of 3.3. In other words, you can’t do worse than the standard curve would otherwise dictate.

*TODO: detailed rules specifying the extent to which collaboration is permissible on the problem sets.*
