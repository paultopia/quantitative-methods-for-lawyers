# Week 1: basics/up and running

## Day 1: minimal programming 

### Pre-class 1: setup

Go through a video tutorial to set up with Azure and Github. 

- get Chrome

- get Azure account

- get Github account and desktop application for your platform

- clone day 1 repo, verify they can successfully run a hello world exercise

- small show-off exercise/"what you'll be able to do" that walks them through a pre-coded flashy thing involving datavis and tearing up some bad analysis? 

### In-class hour: computation basics/building a mental model

(Need a pre-class video for this too)

- loops

- conditionals 

- functions

- computational logic, human logic

## Day 2: conceptual connections between law and code

- expressing some basic legal claims in code 

- Tax code exercise (or some other statutory thing that can be represented in code. Was originally planning Iowa Landlord-Tenant law, but too much manipulation of dates, which I don't want to hit students with.)
