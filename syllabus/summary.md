# Course Summary

This course will review basic principles of probability, statistics, and computational reasoning (including elementary programming) for law students.  Throughout, the emphasis will be on mathematically modest intuition, practical skills, and legal applications. No mathematical background beyond high school algebra will be assumed. 

This course is not advised for students with substantial statistical or computational backgrounds---it is designed as a beginner course.  Nor will it prepare students to be competent empirical researchers or computer programmers---the goal is to give students the capacity to critically evaluate and understand statistical reasoning, and to use computational methods to do so (as well as in their legal practices more generally). Focus will be on breadth rather than depth.
