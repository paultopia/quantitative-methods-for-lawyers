    "For example, suppose you wanted to calculate the thousandth number of the [Fibonacci Sequence](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html) --- the sequence of numbers such that starts with 0 and 1, and then each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers.  For example: \n",

The way it works is that programmers build those primitives---basic arithmetic operations and pushing things around in memory, basically---into more complicated pieces of functionality.
