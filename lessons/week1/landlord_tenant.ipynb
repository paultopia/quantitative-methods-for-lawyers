    "The logic of the law and the logic of computers aren't that different. If you remember back to the logic games section of the LSAT, effectively what you were demonstrating was your ability to engage in structured, conditional reasoning---exactly the same kind of reasoning you have to do when you read a statute, and the kind of reasoning that computers do (and that you have to model) when you program. \n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this, let's represent a few pieces of [Iowa's Landlord-Tenant Act](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/code/562a.pdf) in code. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this, we'll introduce a new programming idea, the **class**.  Basically, a class is a way to collect data of a specific shape, and stuff that you can do with the data, together in a convenient way. You can define a class with the class keyword, and then you can instantiate individual cases of a class (\"instances\" or \"objects\") by calling it like a function.  Let's look at an example."

This is the actual instance of the class that it belongs to, and allows you to access and change properties of that instance (the data it stores). You don't have to pass that in when you call it, it's implicitly passed in.  So this method, when called on an instance of `Termination_Notice`, takes one parameter, `termination_days`, and sets that to the value locked up in the object.  \n",

Because we created an abstract `Termination_Notice` class, we can specify Iowa's particular rule as an instance of a class. If some other state, say, Hawkeye, has a five-day notice, we could also do something like `hawkeye_termination_for_nonpayment = Termination_Notice(5)` and represent Hawkeye's rule.\n",
