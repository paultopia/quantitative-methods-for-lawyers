By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International Public License (\"Public License\"). To
the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these
terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in

    Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
    arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
    permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
    Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
    Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted

    Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public
    License.]{#s1b}
c.  [**Copyright and Similar Rights** means copyright and/or similar
    rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
    performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
    Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized.
    For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section
    [2(b)(1)-(2)](#s2b) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.]{#s1c}
d.  [**Effective Technological Measures** means those measures that, in
    the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
    fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty
    adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
    agreements.]{#s1d}
e.  [**Exceptions and Limitations** means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
    any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
    that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.]{#s1e}
f.  [**Licensed Material** means the artistic or literary work,
    database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this
    Public License.]{#s1f}
g.  [**Licensed Rights** means the rights granted to You subject to the
    terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
    all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
    Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to
    license.]{#s1g}
h.  [**Licensor** means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
    under this Public License.]{#s1h}
i.  [**Share** means to provide material to the public by any means or
    process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as
    reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
    dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
    available to the public including in ways that members of the public
    may access the material from a place and at a time individually
    chosen by them.]{#s1i}

    rights anywhere in the world.]{#s1j}
k.  [**You** means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed
    Rights under this Public License. **Your** has a corresponding
    meaning.]{#s1k}

**Section 2 -- Scope.**

a.  [**License grant**.]{#s2a}
    1.  [Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the
        Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
        non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
        exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material
        to:]{#s2a1}
        A.  [reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in
            part; and]{#s2a1A}
        B.  [produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.]{#s2a1B}
    2.  [[Exceptions and
        Limitations]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}. For the
        avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to
        Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not
        need to comply with its terms and conditions.]{#s2a2}
    3.  [[Term]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}. The term of this
        Public License is specified in Section [6(a)](#s6a).]{#s2a3}
    4.  [[Media and formats; technical modifications
        allowed]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}. The Licensor
        authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and
        formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make
        technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives
        and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You
        from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the
        Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to
        circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of
        this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by
        this Section [2(a)(4)](#s2a4) never produces Adapted
        Material.]{#s2a4}
    5.  [[Downstream
        recipients]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}.]{#s2a5}
        ::: {.para}
        A.  [[Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed
            Material]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}. Every
            recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an
            offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights
            under the terms and conditions of this Public
            License.]{#s2a5A}
        B.  [[No downstream
            restrictions]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}. You may
            not offer or impose any additional or different terms or
            conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures
            to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of
            the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
            Material.]{#s2a5B}
        :::

    6.  [[No endorsement]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}. Nothing
        in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as
        permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of
        the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored,
        endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others
        designated to receive attribution as provided in Section
        [3(a)(1)(A)(i)](#s3a1Ai).]{#s2a6}
b.  ::: {#s2b}
    **Other rights**.

    1.  [Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed
        under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or
        other similar personality rights; however, to the extent
        possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any
        such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary
        to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not
        otherwise.]{#s2b1}
    2.  [Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public
        License.]{#s2b2}
    3.  [To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
        collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
        Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under
        any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing
        scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any
        right to collect such royalties.]{#s2b3}
    :::

**Section 3 -- License Conditions.**

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

a.  ::: {#s3a}
    **Attribution**.

    1.  ::: {#s3a1}
        If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form),
        You must:

        A.  [retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with
            the Licensed Material:]{#s3a1A}
            i.  [identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                Material and any others designated to receive
                attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the
                Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                designated);]{#s3a1Ai}
            ii. [a copyright notice;]{#s3a1Aii}
            iii. [a notice that refers to this Public
                License;]{#s3a1Aiii}
            iv. [a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                warranties;]{#s3a1Aiv}
            v.  [a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                extent reasonably practicable;]{#s3a1Av}
        B.  [indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain
            an indication of any previous modifications; and]{#s3a1B}
        C.  [indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
            Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
            hyperlink to, this Public License.]{#s3a1C}
        :::

    2.  [You may satisfy the conditions in Section [3(a)(1)](#s3a1) in
        any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
        which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
        reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
        hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
        information.]{#s3a2}
    3.  [If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
        information required by Section [3(a)(1)(A)](#s3a1A) to the
        extent reasonably practicable.]{#s3a3}
    4.  [If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter\'s
        License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
        Material from complying with this Public License.]{#s3a4}
    :::

**Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.**

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply
to Your use of the Licensed Material:

a.  [for the avoidance of doubt, Section [2(a)(1)](#s2a1) grants You the
    right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
    portion of the contents of the database;]{#s4a}
b.  [if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
    contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
    Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
    Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material;
    and]{#s4b}
c.  [You must comply with the conditions in Section [3(a)](#s3a) if You
    Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the
    database.]{#s4c}

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section [4](#s4) supplements and does
not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the
Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

**Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.**

a.  [**Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the
    extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and
    as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind
    concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied,
    statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties
    of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
    non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
    the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or
    discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in
    full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.**]{#s5a}
b.  [**To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable
    to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation,
    negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect,
    incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses,
    costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or
    use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised
    of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages.
    Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part,
    this limitation may not apply to You.**]{#s5b}

<!-- -->

c.  [The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
    above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible,
    most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all
    liability.]{#s5c}

**Section 6 -- Term and Termination.**

a.  [This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
    Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
    this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
    terminate automatically.]{#s6a}
b.  ::: {#s6b}
    Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
    Section [6(a)](#s6a), it reinstates:

    1.  [automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
        it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation;
        or]{#s6b1}
    2.  [upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.]{#s6b2}

    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section [6(b)](#s6b) does not
    affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your
    violations of this Public License.
    :::

c.  [For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
    Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
    distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
    will not terminate this Public License.]{#s6c}
d.  [Sections [1](#s1), [5](#s5), [6](#s6), [7](#s7), and [8](#s8)
    survive termination of this Public License.]{#s6d}

**Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.**

a.  [The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
    terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly
    agreed.]{#s7a}
b.  [Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
    Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
    independent of the terms and conditions of this Public
    License.]{#s7b}

**Section 8 -- Interpretation.**

a.  [For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall
    not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions
    on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made
    without permission under this Public License.]{#s8a}
b.  [To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
    deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
    minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
    cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
    without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
    conditions.]{#s8b}
c.  [No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
    failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
    Licensor.]{#s8c}
d.  [Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as
    a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that
    apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of
    any jurisdiction or authority.]{#s8d}
