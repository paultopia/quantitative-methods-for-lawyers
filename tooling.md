# Tooling

Students will work in Python 3.6 (or whatever the latest release minor version is when the class starts), on [Microsoft Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com). Students will clone problem sets, in-class exercises, and tutorials as notebooks from Github directly into Azure. Students will be required to have a Github account. I'll probably also require students to use Chrome just to standardize as much as possible and push the tech support burden to zero. (Most sensible approach is probably to create a course GH organization and make students members of it.)

Because of the problem of Windows users, there will be no command line component to this course. However, I will make bonus tutorials explaining how to use Azure and the commandline embedded in there to push their own code back to github, use Anaconda to get their own decent Python installation, etc. 

Problem sets will be submitted by saving notebooks and submitting over Canvas; I plan to auto-grade them to the extent possible. 

I should also spin up an online platform for quick in-class/in-video quizzes, which won't be graded but will be recorded for data analysis purposes, i.e., for the purposes of formative assessment. This could possibly also be done over Canvas, if I can't find the time to write something better. 

For iOS, [Juno](https://juno.sh) will connect to notebooks on azure (requires $15 pro purchase I think), so students on iOS should be mostly able to function (though they might still have to use the web interface to clone things, etc.).  Is there an equivalent for android?  

In principle, I could use my teaching library to also wrap up some shell commands that can be executed straight from the server on azure notebooks.  I could also just have students buy a cheap $5/month digital ocean or linode and install everything from there with a script.
